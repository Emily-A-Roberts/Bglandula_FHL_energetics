## Welcome

This is the intertidal barnacle energetics project built for the Friday Harbor Laboratories field experiments.

## Quarto information

This project uses quarto. Quarto is similar to Rmarkdown and enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code.
